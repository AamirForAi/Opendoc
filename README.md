## Github Page
The codebase is hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader). But I opened a page in Github for issues like requests, bug reports...
[Github page link](https://github.com/mudlej/mj_pdf/).


## Permissions and privacy
This app does not collect any data.
The following permissions are required to provide specific features in the app:
* *Internet*: For opening PDFs through links
* *Storage*: For saving downloading PDFs and opening them from storage

**Exodus Report**
Exodus privacy reports a tracker in MJ PDF. Yes there is crash tracker in MJ PDF but it does **NOT** send anything unless the user explicitly clicked the SEND button when a crash happens.

MJ PDF uses ACRA (Application Crash Report for Android), which is a library used by developers to collect crash reports and application errors, which helps me improve the app’s stability and performance. It’s important to note that ACRA in MJ PDF [is not used for tracking user behavior or collecting personal information](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/gitlab/mudlej/MjPdfReader/App.kt#L67).

ACRA is open-source and customizable, allowing us to configure it strictly for error reporting. It does not track user movements within the app or gather personal data.

Also, MJ PDF's implementation of ACRA requires explicit user action to send any data. When an app crash occurs, [a dialog](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/gitlab/mudlej/MjPdfReader/App.kt#L85) is presented to the user (`via org.acra.dialog.CrashReportDialog`), where you can view the details and decide whether to send a crash report or not. **No data is transmitted without user's consent** by clicking the 'SEND' button.

1. `CrashReportDialog`: This is the interface that asks for your permission to send a crash report.
2. `JobSenderService` and `LegacySenderService`: These services manage the sending of crash reports, but only activate after you've chosen to send the report.
3. `AcraContentProvider`: This component securely handles crash data on the device until you decide to send it or discard it.

Crash reports allows me to find the most common issues and fix them quickly, ensuring a stable experience for the majority of users.

## What is different from PDF Viewer Plus
After the launch of MJ PDF, Gokul Swaminathan discontinued PDF Viewer Plus app. 
And he [suggested](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/PdfViewer#anouncement) MJ PDF as a replacement.
MJ PDF V2.0 codebase is 400% larger than PDF Viewer Plus without counting the libraries forked for MJ PDF, while being a quarter of its size.
[See changelog](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/change_log.md)

## Underlying Libraries
I Forked [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/barteksc/PdfiumAndroid) to update its core libraries that were years behind and had too many security vulnerabilities.
And Forked [ AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) to add features (like extracting PDF text) and modify some of its behavior (like scroll handle).

* Updated PDFium to 112.0.5579.0 (in v2.0.2) ([source code](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main), [building script](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries))
* Updated libpng to 1.6.39 ([source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.37/), [building script](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/build_dependencies/libpng.py))
* Updated Freetype to 2.13.0 ([source code](https://github.com/freetype/freetype), [building script](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/build_dependencies/freetype2.py))

## How to Build the native part in PdfiumAndroid
This is necessary to compile the code in `mainJNILib.cpp`, ensuring that any modifications made are applied effectively. 
Go to `mj_pdf_reader/PdfiumAndroid/src/main/jni` and run command `$ ndk-build`.
Every future `.aar` or `apk` build will use the generated libs.
